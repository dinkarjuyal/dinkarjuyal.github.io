*This post is a collection of observations around self-supervised learning for vision-based datasets.
This is by no means a complete survey of SSL techniques, and assumes familiarity with Contrastive Learning, Masked Image Modeling and Masked AutoEncoder frameworks. 
For readers intending to get up to speed on these topics, there are excellent resources available online ([1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12210), [2](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2021-05-31-contrastive/)).*
