I am a ML Engineer at Meta working on agentic systems. Previously, I was a Staff ML Researcher and Engineer at PathAI, with a focus on foundation models and computer vision. Some examples of past work -

* **ML methods** -
  + *Foundation Models* - [PLUTO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07905): a scalable & performant Foundation Model for pathology (accepted in following workshops in ICML 2024 - [ML for life and material science](https://ml4lms.bio/), [Foundation models in the wild](https://icml-fm-wild.github.io/) and [Accessible and efficient foundation models for biological discovery](https://accml.bio/index.html) ) 
  + *Domain generalization* - ContriMix (Best-performing official submission in [Camelyon17 Stanford WILDS](https://wilds.stanford.edu/leaderboard/#camelyon17) leaderboard)
  + *Label Imbalance* - [Supervised Contrastive MIL](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2024/papers/Juyal_SC-MIL_Supervised_Contrastive_Multiple_Instance_Learning_for_Imbalanced_Classification_in_WACV_2024_paper.pdf) (WACV 2024)
  + *Interpretability* - [Additive Multiple Instance Learning](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/file/82764461a05e933cc2fd9d312e107d12-Paper-Conference.pdf) (NeurIPS 2022)
